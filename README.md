This is the creation of a single layer perceptron through Python. 
A single-layer perceptron (SLP) is the simplest form of artificial neural network (ANN) consisting of only one layer of nodes, known as neurons or perceptrons. 
This layer is directly connected to the input layer and the output layer, without any intermediate hidden layers. Each neuron in the input layer is connected to each neuron in the output layer by weighted connections.
